# ros2-dev-env-docker
This is a simple tutorial for initializing this Docker development environment.

The first step is to clone this repository to your project path, and you can also choose to rename the folder to whatever you want.

```bash
cd /your/project/path/
git clone https://github.com/Qume2005/ros2-dev-env-docker.git
```

The second step is to find and click the *Dev Environments* tab in Docker Desktop. Then click the *Create+* button.

Finally, just set your project name on the gui and select the file address of the project folder.
