This is a simple tutorial for initializing this Docker Dev environment.

Make sure **Docker Desktop** and **VScode** are installed.

Open the **Docker Desktop**. Find and click the **Dev Environments** button, the **Create+** button, and the **Get started** button.

Set the **Name**, and paste this in the address bar⬇️

```bash
https://github.com/Qume2005/ros2-dev-env-docker.git
```

Click the **Continue** button.

As the build finished, click the **Continue** button again, so you can open your development environment in vscode.
